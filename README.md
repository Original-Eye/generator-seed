# generator-seed [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Original-Eye/generator-seed.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Original-Eye/generator-seed)

An application seed generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) developed by Steve Clements. There is a [Trello](https://trello.com) board that lists some of the detail at [https://trello.com/c/l2hiImxm/1-yo-generator-for-seed](https://trello.com/c/l2hiImxm/1-yo-generator-for-seed)


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

It's an application generator. To install Yeoman, run:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

In this case I've decided to create an application seed generator that builds an application framework based on [express](https://expressjs.com) and [angular](https://angularjs.org). 

To install generator-seed from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-seed
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo seed
```

Now run
```
grunt server
```
and grunt should automatically start a session in your web browser!
